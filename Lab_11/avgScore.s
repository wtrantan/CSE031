# This is the main program.
# It first asks user to enter the number of assignments.
# It then asks user to input the scores, one at a time.
# It then calls selSort to perform selection sort.
# It then calls printArray twice to print out contents of the original and sorted scores.
# It then asks user to enter the number of (lowest) scores to drop.
# It then calls calcSum on the sorted array with the adjusted length (to account for dropped scores).
# It then prints out average score with the specified number of (lowest) scores dropped from the calculation.
